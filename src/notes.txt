Date: 5/9/2021
      What did I do?
           Went to rapid api and got the api keys
           Created another folder in the src folder and created a index.js file in it.
           Imported axios and pasted the general axios get Url functionality code.
           Created three state variables , as follows:-
                       *places ,setPlaces = empty array[]
                       *coords ,setCoords = empty object{}
                       *bounds ,setBounds = null
           Here coords is the center coordinates of the map displayed
           And the notheast and southwest boundaries of the map is the bounds as we are going to display 
             the attractions only on the specified bounds.
           Passed the coords ,setCoords ,and setBounds to the Map component as props.
           Imported the cords ,setCoords and the setBounds in the Map component as props.
           In the <GoogleMapReact></GoogleMapReact> component in the onChange property added a callback
                function with e (event) as parameter and setCoords({lat : e.center.lat ,lng :e.center.lng})
           And passed the imported coords to the center and default center property.
           Still it won't work, so in the app.js create a useEffect and add the built in function:-

              navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(({coords:{latitude ,longitude}}) => {
                 setCoords({lat:latitude ,lng:longitude})
              })
           Again in the App.js create another useEffect and call the getPlaceDetails() which is created in the
             api folder's index.js
           And set the places state variable to data inside the call back function .then(()=>{

           })
           This is what did today. Everything working well will see in the next functionality

Date 9/9/2021
       What did I do?

       Displayed the place card on the map
       Added the website button on the list card.
Date 10/9/2021
      What did I do?
      Checked the childClicked functionality
      And scrolled to that specific component in list using useEffect and react ref
      In the useEffect created a const and stored the references into a constant.
      And updated the State variable to the value of the constant.
      In the list component where the Placedetail component is called, added two props i.e 
                          selected={Number(childClicked) === i}
                          refProp={elRefs[i]}
      In the Placedetails component recieved the value as props and using if statement , and the we get an error 
        saying "length is not defined"
         This how to solve the error:-
                      The error is because we did not tell the start component i.e we don't have the places at
                       start.
                     Here i where we use CircularProgress.
                     In the App.js create a state variable isLoading and initiate it with false.
                     And recieve the isLoading as props in the List and and use this logic:-
                         {isLoading ? (
               <div className={classes.loading}>
                   <CircularProgress size="5rem"/>
               </div>
           ) : ( 
               <>
               </>
           )}
      Now we need to switch between Restaurants ,Hotels ,and Attractions.
